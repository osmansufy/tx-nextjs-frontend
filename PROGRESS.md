## Snapshot

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Current phase** | Phase 1 — Marketing site V1 |
| **Last updated** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Hard blockers** | `Settings_Controller` `GET /lms-backend/v1/settings` — without this, site branding falls back to env vars only |
| **Soft blockers** | `partner_logo` CPT, `testimonial` CPT — these sections render empty on home page until backend ships |

## Phases

Legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

### Phase 0 — API alignment + BFF scaffolding ✅ COMPLETE

All 15 PRs landed. Full list in **Phase 0 — PR backlog** below.

---

### Phase 1 — Marketing site V1 _(current)_

Phase 1 is split into sprints by dependency order. Build the ones with no blockers first.

#### Sprint 1.1 — Course catalog (no backend blockers)

These use `serverApi` which already works. Ship these first.

- [ ] `CourseCard` component — `next/image` with `sizes`, price badge, rating stars, instructor line
- [ ] `/courses` list page — RSC, `serverApi.courses.list()`, filter bar (category, level, price), pagination, empty state
- [ ] `/courses/[slug]` detail page — hero, curriculum accordion (units list), instructor card, reviews strip, sticky enroll sidebar
- [ ] `generateStaticParams` for course slugs (ISR at 10 min) + `generateMetadata` (OG, JSON-LD Course schema)
- [ ] `/course-categories/[slug]` — filtered course list by category
- [ ] Revalidate webhook — `POST /api/revalidate?secret=X&tag=course:slug` calls `revalidateTag()`

#### Sprint 1.2 — Home page (available sections)

- [ ] Hero — full-bleed image/video, headline from settings or fallback copy, two CTAs
- [ ] Featured + popular courses grid (RSC `serverApi.courses.featured()` + `serverApi.courses.popular()`)
- [ ] Category strip — `serverApi.taxonomy.categories()`, icon per category
- [ ] Blog preview — 3 latest posts via `serverApi.blog.posts({ per_page: 3 })`, RSC
- [ ] Newsletter subscribe — Client Component, `POST /api/newsletter`, success/error states
- [ ] Stats bar — 4 numbers (courses, students, instructors, countries); read from settings or hardcode until `Settings_Controller` ships

#### Sprint 1.3 — Home page (blocked sections)

Do not fake these with hardcoded data. Render nothing or a layout placeholder until the backend tickets are done.

- [ ] Partner logos — blocked on `partner_logo` CPT + REST (`/wp/v2/partner_logo`)
- [ ] Testimonials carousel — blocked on `testimonial` CPT + REST (`/wp/v2/testimonial`)
- [ ] Pricing teaser — blocked on WC Subscriptions wrapper (`/memberships/*`)

#### Sprint 1.4 — Supporting pages

- [ ] `/blog` listing (RSC, pagination, featured post hero)
- [ ] `/blog/[slug]` — full post, `generateMetadata`, JSON-LD Article schema
- [ ] `/contact` — static form, `POST /api/contact`, honeypot field, rate-limit in route handler
- [ ] `/about` — static content, pulled from WP page API if available
- [ ] `/faq` — accordion, sourced from WP FAQ CPT or hardcoded
- [ ] `/pricing` — plan cards; fallback to hardcoded until subscriptions API lands

#### Sprint 1.5 — SEO + performance (do before launch, not after)

These are not optional. Skipping them means a reindex after launch.

- [ ] `generateMetadata` on every page (title, description, canonical, OG, Twitter card)
- [ ] JSON-LD on `/courses/[slug]` (Course), `/blog/[slug]` (Article), `/` (Organization)
- [ ] `next/image` `sizes` audit — every image in the codebase, check `sizes` is correct for its layout slot
- [ ] Verify `sitemap.ts` returns all course + blog slugs; add `/categories/*` entries
- [ ] Lighthouse CI baseline — target LCP < 2.5 s, CLS < 0.1, TBT < 200 ms on mobile

---

### Phase 2 — Auth + student dashboard

Auth pages are already wired to BFF (Phase 0). What's left is the UI.

- [ ] Login page UI — form, error states, redirect-after-login (`?next=` param)
- [ ] Register page UI — name + email + password, T&C checkbox
- [ ] Forgot-password + reset-password pages (routes exist, need polished UI)
- [ ] Dashboard — enrolled courses, progress rings, resume last unit CTA
- [ ] Profile — edit name/avatar/bio, change password, delete account
- [ ] Certificates + badges listing pages
- [ ] Orders history page

### Phase 3 — Commerce

Blocked on backend tickets for cart, checkout, WC Subscriptions.

- [ ] Cart drawer — `POST /api/cart`
- [ ] Checkout flow — Stripe Elements, order creation, WC order status webhook
- [ ] Membership purchase → auto-enroll
- [ ] Orders detail page

### Phase 4 — Bundles, instructors, search v2, notifications

- [ ] Per backend availability

### Phase 5 — Hardening

- [ ] Auth: token rotation test, CSRF review
- [ ] Sentry: adjust sample rates for production traffic volume
- [ ] Web Vitals: RUM integration, field data feedback loop
- [ ] E2E coverage: critical paths (enroll, checkout, complete unit, cert download)

## Known tech debt (fix before Phase 2, not Phase 3)

These are real problems, not nice-to-haves.

| # | Issue | Impact | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TD-1 | `fetchSettings()` called twice per render (in `generateMetadata` and `RootLayout`) | Extra round-trip to WP on every cold render | Memoize with `React.cache()` in `settings.server.ts` |
| TD-2 | `serverApi` returns `unknown` everywhere | No type safety on RSC data — casting is silent runtime bomb | Replace `unknown` with proper types as each page is built |
| TD-3 | `hexToHslChannels()` has no unit test | Colour override silently broken if input format changes | Add tests to `color.test.ts` |
| TD-4 | `proxyToWP` refreshes token on 401 but doesn't propagate the new cookie to the response in a streaming context | Will fail when streaming RSC added | Add `Set-Cookie` forwarding to refresh path |
| TD-5 | No request correlation ID in BFF | Impossible to trace a specific user request across Next.js and WP logs | Add `X-Request-Id` header via middleware, pass through `proxyToWP` |
| TD-6 | Vitest coverage near zero | Regressions invisible | Target 60% coverage on `lib/` utilities and services before Phase 2 launch |
